Hey There, I've included a script called commands_used.sh

I've been using that and basically the same raw_data to gather data
about how machines other than the college's sever(s) behave.

My Primary Desktop: Xubuntu 14.04, both zsh and bash give desired results
My Laptop: Arch Linux, both zsh and bash give desired results
My Secondary Desktop: Slackware 14.1, bash works
Mac Mini in the Computer Science lab: Results TBD
